- **Game State Manager**: Persistent storage for scores and settings
- **Dynamic Physics**: Adaptive game difficulty and mechanics
- **Modular Components**: Improved code organization and reusability

## 🎪 Difficulty Progression

The game becomes progressively more challenging:

- **Level 1-10**: Base difficulty with standard pipe speed and gaps
- **Level 11-20**: Increased pipe speed and slightly smaller gaps
- **Level 21+**: Maximum challenge with fastest speed and minimum gaps

## 🏆 Scoring System

- **Points**: Earn 1 point for each pipe successfully passed
- **High Score**: Automatically saved and persists between sessions
- **Statistics**: Track total games played over time
- **Difficulty Indicator**: Shows current difficulty level in game over screen

## 🎵 Sound Effects

All sound effects are web-hosted and load automatically:

- Wing flap sound for each tap
- Point scoring sound for successful pipe passes
- Game over sound for collisions
- Toggle sound on/off with the speaker icon

## 🎨 Visual Design

The game features a cohesive visual design with:

- Realistic pipe textures with 3D effects
- Animated bird with rotation based on movement
- Layered ground with grass and dirt textures
- Professional UI with shadows and gradients
- Smooth animations and transitions
