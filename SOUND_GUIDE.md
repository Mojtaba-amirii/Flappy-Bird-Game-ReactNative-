## ⚙️ After Downloading Sounds:

1. Place the 4 sound files in `assets/sounds/` folder
2. Open `src/utils/soundManager.js`
3. Uncomment these lines (around line 35):

```javascript
// Remove the // from the beginning of these lines:
this.audioPlayers.flap = useAudioPlayer(
  require("../../assets/sounds/flap.mp3")
);
this.audioPlayers.point = useAudioPlayer(
  require("../../assets/sounds/point.mp3")
);
this.audioPlayers.hit = useAudioPlayer(require("../../assets/sounds/hit.mp3"));
this.audioPlayers.gameOver = useAudioPlayer(
  require("../../assets/sounds/gameOver.mp3")
);
```

4. Change `this.soundsLoaded = false;` to `this.soundsLoaded = true;`

## 🎮 Quick Sound Recommendations:

If you want to get started quickly, search for these specific terms:

1. **"bird wing flap 0.1 seconds"** → flap.mp3
2. **"bell ding short"** → point.mp3
3. **"thud impact short"** → hit.mp3
4. **"game over fail sound"** → gameOver.mp3

## 🔧 Testing:

After adding the sounds, your game will automatically use actual audio instead of haptic feedback. You'll see console messages like:

- `Sound: Played flap audio file` (instead of haptic fallback)

The game will still work if sounds aren't loaded (using haptic feedback as backup).
